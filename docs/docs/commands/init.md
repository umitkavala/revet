# revet init

Generate a starter `.revet.toml` configuration file in the current directory.

```bash
revet init                  # create .revet.toml in current directory
revet init /path/to/project # create in a specific directory
```

The generated file includes all available options with their defaults and comments explaining each setting. Edit it to enable additional modules, configure AI, add custom rules, or adjust suppression paths.

See [Configuration →](../configuration) for the full reference.
